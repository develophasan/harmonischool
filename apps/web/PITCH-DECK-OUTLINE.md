# 🚀 Harmoni - Investor Pitch Deck Outline

## 12 Slides Structure

### Slide 1: Title
**Harmoni**
Neurodevelopment Intelligence Platform

*Transforming early childhood development tracking with neuroscience and AI*

---

### Slide 2: Problem
**The Gap in Early Childhood Development**

- Early childhood delays detected too late (after age 3-4)
- Current solutions: Static reports, subjective observations
- No neuroscience-backed tracking
- Parents lack actionable insights
- Schools lack data-driven tools

**Impact**: 1 in 6 children have developmental delays, but only 30% receive early intervention.

---

### Slide 3: Market
**Massive and Growing Market**

- Global Early Childhood Education: $200B+
- Child Development Services: $50B+
- EdTech in ECE: $15B+ (growing 20% YoY)
- Target: 50,000+ preschools in Turkey, 500K+ globally

---

### Slide 4: Current Solutions
**Why Existing Solutions Fail**

❌ **Static Reports**: PDFs, no real-time insights
❌ **Subjective Observations**: Teacher bias, inconsistent
❌ **No Neuroscience**: Not based on developmental psychology
❌ **Reactive**: Problems detected too late
❌ **No AI**: Manual analysis, no predictive insights

**Result**: Delayed intervention, missed opportunities
