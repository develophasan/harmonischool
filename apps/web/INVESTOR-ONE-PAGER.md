**Neurodevelopment Intelligence Platform for Early Childhood**

## Problem

Developmental delays are detected too late (after age 3-4). Current solutions are static reports, subjective observations, and lack neuroscience backing. **1 in 6 children** have developmental delays, but only **30% receive early intervention**.

---

## Solution

AI-powered, cohort-normalized neurodevelopment tracking with:
- **10-domain neuro profiles** (executive functions, language, motor, etc.)
- **Clinical-grade Z-scores** (CDC/Bayley compatible)
- **Predictive trajectories** (3-month forecasts)
- **Adaptive activity recommendations**
- **AI copilots** (Teacher + Parent personas)

**Core Value**: Early detection → Early intervention → Better outcomes

---

## Technology

### Core Engine
- **Z-Score Cohort Engine**: Same-age cohort statistics (±3 months)
- **Clinical Risk Modeling**: CDC/Bayley compatible thresholds
- **Predictive Trajectories**: ML-based 3-month forecasts
- **Adaptive Activities**: Domain-specific recommendations
- **AI Copilots**: Domain-specific personas with clinical language

### Tech Moat
- **Longitudinal Dataset**: Largest in Turkey (projected)
- **Neuro Models**: 10-domain framework
- **Clinical Validation**: 10 domains validated against Bayley, Vineland, PDMS-2
- **Data Network Effects**: More children = better benchmarks
